# Teensy Electronic leadscrew
This is an implementation of an electronic leadscrew using a Teensy microcrontroller.

# Architecture
We use [https://platformio.org/](platformio) as the infrastructure to build this project.

# Installation
You will currently need to setup platformio to build this, it can also handle installation to your teensy as well.
NOTE: you will have to modify some of the configuration to get this set up for your particular lathe, instructions coming soon.
